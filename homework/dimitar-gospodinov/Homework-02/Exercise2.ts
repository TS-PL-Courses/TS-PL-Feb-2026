// Exercise 2: Check if a number is between two other numbers
// Step 1: Declare 3 number variables.
// Step 2: Check if the first number is between the second and third numbers using if-else statements.
// Step 3: Log the result like so:
// "The number {first number} is between {second number} and {third number}"
// "The number {first number} is NOT between {second number} and {third number}"

let firstNumber: number = 67;
let secondNumber: number = 123;
let thirdNumber: number = 739;

} else {
  console.log(`The number ${firstNumber} is NOT between ${secondNumber} and ${thirdNumber}`);
